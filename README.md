# Tinder_Webscrape_for_FacePref
Webscraping Tinders API to download profiles of people that show up within the Area you are in. Will have to manually sort, and delete objects obstructing the face, and group photos for AI Facial Recognition Training. 


The Idea behind this project came when I had a couple of buddies break up with their long term relationships. This project was a way to kill two birds with one stone. They wanted to work with me on a AI bot and this portion they could do with me. 

The idea was that we would all get together after webscraping photos, to feed into an AI bot, and they would be able to use the AI in a simple GUI, to speed up the dating apps, and spend less time on the applications as a whole. 

I think that this project will take approx a year to do, due to the massive amounts of data, and the amount of sorting. 

The goal with this AI project is to get the bot to swipe with an accuracy of approx 90% and Send the inital messages from a list that we will have to create. I think the only reason that this project will take so long, is that the pictures that are uploaded to tinder, arent the greatest, and the facial features of people, can't be easily picked out. We had to make a GUI to delete, pictures, and to grade people profiles.
